    **Smart Compliance Operations Unit Tool** is an AI-assisted prototype developed to revolutionise 
    the way unit addresses are processed for occupant identification and compliance detection 
    of unauthorised use.
    
    This innovative solution combines advanced artificial intelligence with automated 
    processing capabilities to streamline smart compliance operations and ensure regulatory compliance.

    The scope of this project encompasses the development of an intelligent system that:
    
    ‚Ä¢ **Resolves Unit Addresses**: Automatically processes and standardises address formats
    
    ‚Ä¢ **Identifies Occupants**: Uses AI to determine current occupants of specified addresses
    
    ‚Ä¢ **Detects Compliance Issues**: Identifies potential unauthorised use of spaces
    
    ‚Ä¢ **Automates Assessment**: Reduces manual processing time and human error
    
    ‚Ä¢ **Provides Actionable Insights**: Generates comprehensive reports for enforcement actions
