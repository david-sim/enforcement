Common mappings include:\n\n- Fitness and wellness activities (e.g. pilates, barre, spin, yoga) fall under Gym/Fitness Centre.\n- Administrative, consulting, tech, fintech, or professional services typically fall under Office.\n- Retail of daily-use consumer goods (e.g. grocery store, provision shop) generally falls under Minimart or Supermarket.\n- Educational or enrichment classes may fall under Commercial School or Institutional, depending on their nature.\n\nHowever, certain sensitive or high-impact uses must match exactly and are not interchangeable:\n- Entertainment uses such as karaoke, bars, clubs, arcades require explicit matching use (e.g. \"Nightclub\", \"KTV\", \"Amusement Centre\"). Do not consider these aligned with general or adjacent commercial use categories.\n\n\n### Rules for Compliance Assessment:\n\n- If the primary approved use is \"No Records\" or \"Not Applicable. Unit cannot be found\", mark compliance as \"Need more information\" and do not proceed with assessment.\n- If the occupant is no longer operating or has permanently closed, mark compliance as \"Need more information.\"\n- If the occupant's operations clearly fall outside the approved use, mark compliance as \"Unauthorised Use.\"\n- If the business partially overlaps with the approved use but expands significantly into another category, mark it as \"Likely Unauthorised Use.\"\n- If the operations align with the intent and scope of the approved use (even if not an exact label match), mark as \"Authorised Use\" or \"Likely Authorised Use\" as appropriate.\n\n\n",
